What is a Histogram (in Coding Terms)?

A histogram is a visual representation of frequency â€” it shows how many times something appears.
In Python, you can simulate a text-based histogram using * symbols.

'''
def print_histogram(items):
    for i in items:
        print('*' * i)

values = [2,5,7]
print_histogram(values)
